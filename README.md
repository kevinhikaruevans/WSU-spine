WSU Spine
================================

As a visual element, the WSU Spine is a 198px wide column that binds together the many websites of wsu.edu. As a framework, the WSU Spine is a minimal template that provides a responsive and flexible grid for every WSU website. With a uniform and global spine on the left and a blank, unwritten page to the right, the Spine upholds the unity and diversity of our university.

1. Consistently brands the university across websites and platforms
2. Provides a usable and consistent navigation solution
3. Provides a responsive solution for devices


Implementation
================================
A typical implementation of the WSU Spine would start with spine.html.

1. Customize #spine by replacing default data with the appropriate contact details.
2. Customize the markup in spine.html by adding any out-of-the-box modifications, such as changing the color of the spine. Customization options can be found in the comments of spine.html and, for some lesser used options, at brand.wsu.edu.
3. Rebuild the markup in your CMS of choice while taking care to preserve its elements and structure.
